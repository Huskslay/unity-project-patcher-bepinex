<!-- About the Project -->
## About the Project

This allows a Unity project to utilize most of BepInEx plugins inside the editor

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> From testing, this does not seem to support preloader plugins that modify the Assembly-CSharp assembly, such as
> MMHOOK.
>
> For plugins that require dll generation, or other unique behaviours, run them on the game build first and then copy
> them into the editor's bepinex folder, or in the editor, for usage!

<!-- Features -->
## Features

- In-editor BepInEx usage
- Supports in-project plugins
- Supports local/game/custom BepInEx target directories
- Most plugins can be replaced in-place as long as they have no long lasting dll hooks
- And more

### PluginBlockerUserSettings

This lets you block plugins from running their `Awake` functions. Useful for plugins that use things that aren't
imported into the project, such as Steam usage.

Each name has to be in the format of `Namespace.TypeName`.
